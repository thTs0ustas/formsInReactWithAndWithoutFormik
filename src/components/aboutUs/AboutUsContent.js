      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Retro Cinema has been the iconic home of cinema in the Athens since it
        opened with MGM’s David Oster on November 22, 1935. Since its opening,
        it has been the home of every novelty movie from the classic "Drakula",
        all the way to the most retro type of movies. The cinema had to be
        rennovated a total of 3 times due to it sustaining severe damage around
        1985 from a very strong earthquake.
